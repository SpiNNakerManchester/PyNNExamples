"""
Simple test for neuromodulated-STDP with structural plasticity
We take 10 populations of 49 stimuli neurons and connect to each
10 post-synaptic populations of 49 neurons. The spiking of stimuli causes some
spikes in post-synaptic neurons initially.
We then inject reward signals from dopaminergic neurons
periodically to reinforce synapses that are active. This
is followed by increased weights of some synapses and thus
increased response to the stimuli.
We then proceed to inject punishment signals from dopaminergic
neurons which causes an inverse effect to reduce response of
post-synaptic neurons to the same stimuli.
At the same time we implement a straightforward creation/elimination structural
method (similar to that used in the other structural plasticity examples).

This uses the split neuron-synapse modelling as otherwise the neuromodulated
STDP, structural plasticity and neuron instructions would not fit on one core
